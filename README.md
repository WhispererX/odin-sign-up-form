# Odin Sign-Up Form

**Odin Sign-Up Form** is a learning project designed to showcase my HTML and CSS skills. Through this project, I demonstrate my ability to create clean, and visually appealing web forms, while practicing best practices in front-end development.

This project focuses on:

- Structuring forms using semantic HTML
- Styling forms with CSS, including layout, colors, and typography
- Creating a user-friendly sign-up experience
